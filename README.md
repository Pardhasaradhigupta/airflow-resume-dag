# Airflow Resume DAG | GCP Data Engineer Portfolio

This repository demonstrates my experience as a Google Cloud–certified Data Engineer by implementing my professional resume as an Apache Airflow DAG.

The project highlights hands-on skills in data orchestration, ETL/ELT pipeline design, Cloud Composer operations, BigQuery optimization, CI/CD automation, infrastructure as code, and production monitoring.

## Professional Summary

GCP-certified Data Engineer with 3+ years of experience building scalable ETL/ELT pipelines on Google Cloud Platform.

Strong experience in:
- Apache Airflow (Cloud Composer)
- BigQuery performance and cost optimization
- Infrastructure as Code using Terraform
- CI/CD pipeline implementation
- Monitoring, alerting, and data governance

---

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to demonstrate how I design and operate production-grade data pipelines using Apache Airflow.

Instead of a static resume, this project represents my experience as a structured and observable workflow, reflecting real-world data engineering practices used in enterprise environments.
